# Retrieve and Rank Demo app
The IBM Watsonâ„¢ Retrieve and Rank service helps users find the most relevant information for their queries by using a combination of search and machine learning algorithms to detect "signals" in the data. You load your data into the service, which is built on top of Apache Solr, and train a machine learning model. Then use the trained model to provide improved results to users.

View a [demo](http://retrieve-and-rank-demo.mybluemix.net/rnr-demo/dist/index.html#/) of this app.

## How it works
This application uses publicly available test data called the [Cranfield collection](http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/cran/). The collection contains abstracts of aerodynamics journal articles, a set of questions about aerodynamics, and labels to mark how relevant an article is to a question. Some questions are not used as training data, which means that you can use them to validate the performance of the trained ranker. This subset of questions are are used in the demo.

#### Training the Service by completing the tutorial
Configure the service to use the Cranfield collection and train a ranker with the Cranfield data.

* Complete the tutorial in <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/retrieve-rank/get_start.shtml" target="_blank">Getting started with the Retrieve and Rank service</a>.     
* As you complete the tutorial, save this information:
  * Solr cluster ID: The unique identifier of the Apache Solr Cluster that you create.
  * Collection name: The name you give to the Solr collection when you create it.  
  * Ranker ID: The unique identifier of the ranker you create.


#### Setting up environment variables in Bluemix
Use the values from the tutorial to specify environment variables in
your app.  

1. Navigate to the application dashboard in Bluemix. 
2. Click the Retrieve and Rank application you created earlier. 
3. Click **Environment Variables**. 
4. Click **USER-DEFINED**. 
5. Add the following three environment variables with the values that
   you copied from the tutorial:
  * `CLUSTER_ID`
  * `COLLECTION_NAME`
  * `RANKER_ID`

## Build the app
This project is configured to be built with Maven.

1. In your Eclipse window, expand the **retrieve-and-rank-java** project that you cloned from GitHub.
2. Right-click the project and select **Maven > Update Project** to update Maven dependencies.
3. Keep the default options, and click **OK**.
4. Navigate to the location of your default deployment server. For Websphere Liberty, it is located in a location similar to this: `../LibertyRuntime/usr/servers/{server-name}`.
5. Open the `server.env` file (create one if it doesn't exist), and set the following entries:
  
  * `VCAP_SERVICES`: Add the JSON object that is displayed in the
    **Environment Variables** section of your application on
    Bluemix. When you add the JSON here, format it on a single line.
  * For `CLUSTER_ID`, `COLLECTION_NAME`, and `RANKER_ID`, use the same values that you used for the environment variables in your app on Bluemix. For example:
    
    ```
    VCAP_SERVICES={"retrieve_and_rank": [{"name": "rr-demo-app","label": "retrieve_and_rank","plan": "standard","credentials": {"url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/retrieveandrank/api", "username": "{username}", "password": "{password}" } } ] }
    CLUSTER_ID=sc1ca23733_faa8_49ce_b3b6_dc3e193264c6
    COLLECTION_NAME=example-collection
    RANKER_ID=B2E325-rank-67
    ```
    
6. Switch to the navigator view in Eclipse. 
7. Right-click the `pom.xml` file, and select **Run As > Maven Install**. Installation of Maven begins. During the installation, the following tasks are completed:
    * The JS code is compiled. The various Angular JS files are aggregated, "uglified," and compressed. Various other pre-processing is performed on the web code, and the output is copied to the `retrieve-and-rank-java/src/main/webapp/dist` folder in the project.
    * The Java code is compiled, and JUnit tests are executed against the Java code. The compiled Java and JavaScript code and various other artifacts that are required by the web project are copied to a temporary location, and a .war file is created in `/retrieve-and-rank-java/target` directory. This WAR file is used to deploy the application on Bluemix in the next section.

## Deploy the app
You can run the application on a local server or on Bluemix. Choose one of the following methods, and complete the steps:

#### Deploying the app on your local server in Eclipse
1. In Eclipse, click **Window > Show View > Servers**.
2. In the **Servers** view, right-click and select **New > Server**.
3. Select the **WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile** in the **Define a New Server** window and click **Next**.  
4. Configure the server with the default settings.
